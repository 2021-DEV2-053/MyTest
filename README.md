# TicTacToe - Test
TicTacToe (Android app) is a game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical row wins the game.

### Getting started
To build a project, enter the project directory and use the `./gradlew assemble` command or use "Import Project" in Android Studio.
- Use `./gradlew connectedAndroidTest` to run the tests on a connected device.

### Requirements
- buildToolsVersion `31.0.0`
- compileSdk `31` - Android version 12
- minSdk `21` - Android version 5

### Architecture
My project architecture is based on the "Android Architecture Components" from Google, to provide a cleaner code, with clear separation between the view, the data and the business logic. <br>
Data is observed using Kotlin Flows and the DataBinding Library binds UI components in layouts to the DataSources ( Players and Games ).


### Built With
- `Kotlin` - official programming language for Android development 
- `Coroutines` - for background operations.
- `Room` - Persistence of Data.
- `Hilt` - Dependency Injection Framework.
- `Navigation component` - to manage fragment operations.
- `Material` -  for the user interface
